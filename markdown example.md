# Welcome to Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents

## How to use this?

1. Write markdown in the markdown editor window
2. See the rendered markdown in the preview window

### Features

- Creates headings, paragraphs, links, blockquotes, inline-code, code blocks and lists
- Name and save the document to acces again later
- Choose between Light or Dark mode dependind on your preference

#### Headings

To create a heading, add the hash sign (#) before the heading. The number of hash signs you use should correspond to the heading level. You'll see in this guide that we've used all six heading levels (not necessarly in the correct way you should use headings!) to illustrate how they should look.

##### Lists

You can see exemples of ordered and unordered lists above.

###### Code Blocks

This markdown editor allows for in-line snippets, like this: `<p>I'm inline</p>`. It also allows for larger code blocks like this:

```
<main>
    <h1>This is a larger code block</h1>
</main>
```
